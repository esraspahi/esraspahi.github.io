Hello, I’m Esra

I am a PhD candidate in **English Language Teaching (ELT)** at TED University , and a **Research Assistant** at Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University. My research interests lie at the intersection of **technology in language education**, **AI-assisted feedback**, and **conversation analysis**. I explore how digital tools can support reflective teaching and foster meaningful student engagement.

Currently, I’m working on projects related to:
- The impact of generative AI feedback on student motivation in writing,
- Enhancing teacher feedback literacy through automated tools,
- Virtual exchanges and multimodal discourse in online language learning environments.
